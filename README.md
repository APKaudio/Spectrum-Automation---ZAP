## 1. Get Python üêç

The first step is to install Python, the programming language needed to run the script. This section will guide you to the official download page and highlight the most important part of the installation process.

**Go to the official Python website to download the correct installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux):**

üëâ [**Download Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Tip for Windows Users!**  
> On the first screen of the installer, you **must** check the box that says  
> **"Add Python X.Y to PATH"**.  
> This allows your computer to find Python easily from any folder.

## 2. Install Helper Tools üõ†Ô∏è

The script needs a few helper tools (libraries) to function correctly. Use `pip`, Python's package installer, in your **Command Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (macOS/Linux)**.

```bash
pip install pyvisa
```

```bash
pip install numpy
```

```bash
pip install pandas
```

```bash
pip install plotly
```

## 3. Prepare Your Workspace üè†

Before running the script:

### 1. Save the Script

### 2. Navigate to the Folder

Use the `cd` (change directory) command. Example for Windows:

```bash
cd C:\ScanApp
```
